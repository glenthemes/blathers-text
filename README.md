### üëã‚ÄÑIntroduction:

`blathersText()` is a JavaScript plugin that generates quotes from Blathers by specifying a category (e.g. bugs, fish), or leaving it blank to retrieve a random quote. All quotes are from the official ACNH game, which Blathers will say when the player donates a specimen and presses *"Tell me about this!"*.

### üí°‚ÄÑPurpose:
Just for fun! Blathers yaps a lot, so I figured it would be a perfect opportunity to spice up [lorem ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/).
